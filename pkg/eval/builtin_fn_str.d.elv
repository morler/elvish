# Output the width of `$string` when displayed on the terminal. Examples:
#
# ```elvish-transcript
# ~> wcswidth a
# â–¶ (num 1)
# ~> wcswidth lorem
# â–¶ (num 5)
# ~> wcswidth ä½ å¥½ï¼Œä¸–ç•Œ
# â–¶ (num 10)
# ```

# Override the column width of a Unicode rune to a specific non-negative value.
# If `$width` is negative, removes the override for that rune.
#
# This function is useful for handling terminal compatibility issues with certain
# Unicode characters that may not display with their expected width on specific
# terminals or environments.
#
# ```elvish-transcript
# ~> # First, see the normal width of an emoji
# ~> wcswidth ðŸŒŸ
# â–¶ (num 2)
# ~> # Override the width to be 1 column instead of 2
# ~> -override-wcwidth ðŸŒŸ 1
# ~> wcswidth ðŸŒŸ
# â–¶ (num 1)
# ~> # Remove the override (use negative width)
# ~> -override-wcwidth ðŸŒŸ -1
# ~> wcswidth ðŸŒŸ
# â–¶ (num 2)
# ```
#
# **Note**: This function takes a single Unicode rune, not a multi-rune string.
# Use `(all)` to apply overrides to multiple characters.
#
# See also [`wcswidth`](#wcswidth).
fn '-override-wcwidth' {|rune width| }

# Convert arguments to string values.
#
# ```elvish-transcript
# ~> to-string foo [a] [&k=v]
# â–¶ foo
# â–¶ '[a]'
# â–¶ '[&k=v]'
# ```
fn to-string {|@value| }

# Outputs a string for each `$number` written in `$base`. The `$base` must be
# between 2 and 36, inclusive. Examples:
#
# ```elvish-transcript

# â–¶ 1
# â–¶ 11
# â–¶ 100
# â–¶ 10000
# â–¶ 11111111
# ~> base 16 1 3 4 16 255
