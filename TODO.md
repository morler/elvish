## Long-term / Major Refactoring Projects

### TUI Stack Rewrite
**Status**: 🔮 LONG-TERM PLAN - Moved to long-term roadmap (2025-08-24)  
**Location**: `pkg/edit` (62 files), `pkg/cli` (109 files)  
**Scope**: Complete rewrite of Terminal User Interface framework (~22K lines of code)  
**Description**: Major architectural refactoring of the entire TUI stack. The current editor implementation built on `cli.App` needs modernization.

**Analysis Summary** (completed 2025-08-24):
- **Architecture**: Layered design with pkg/edit built on pkg/cli framework
- **Technical Debt**: 30+ TODO items identified in codebase
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Breaking changes to core user interface
- **Resource Estimate**: 9-12 months development cycle
- **Team Requirements**: 4-5 dedicated developers (architect, core devs, test engineer, documentation)

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Phase 1** (2-3 months): Architecture design and prototyping
- **Phase 2** (4-5 months): Core framework rewrite and component migration  
- **Phase 3** (2-3 months): Integration testing, documentation, and release preparation

**Success Criteria**:
- All existing TUI functionality preserved
- Performance at least equal to current implementation
- Improved maintainability and extensibility
- Cross-platform compatibility (especially Windows improvements)
- Comprehensive test coverage and documentation

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Gradual migration with feature flags
- Parallel maintenance of old and new frameworks during transition
- Extensive beta testing with community feedback
- Clear rollback procedures for critical issues

**Priority Rationale**: Moved to long-term plan due to high resource requirements and risk level. Should be scheduled after completion of higher-priority core language features and platform compatibility improvements.

## Notes

- Most TODO items are tracked as inline comments in the source code
- Priority should be given to items that affect core functionality or user experience
- Windows support improvements would significantly expand platform compatibility
- Major refactoring projects (like TUI rewrite) are documented in the "Long-term" section with detailed analysis
