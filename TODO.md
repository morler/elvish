### Windows Platform Compatibility Enhancement
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Phase 1 Completed (2025-08-24)  
**Priority**: High - Critical for platform expansion and user base growth  
**Locations**: Multiple files with `*_windows.go` suffix, cross-platform modules
**Description**: Comprehensive improvement of Windows platform support to achieve feature parity with Unix-like systems.

**Background**: Current Windows support has significant gaps affecting user experience, with multiple Windows-specific TODO items and test failures. This limits Elvish's adoption on Windows platforms and affects the note in go.mod upgrade that mentions "minor Windows-specific test failures expected".

**Phase 1 Completed (2025-08-24)**:
âœ… **File System Operations**
- âœ… `pkg/mods/os/stat_windows.go`: Implemented CreationTime, LastAccessTime, LastWriteTime metadata extraction
  - Added `filetimeToTime()` function to convert Windows FILETIME to Go time.Time
  - Updated `statSysMap()` to include all three Windows-specific timestamps
  - Proper Windows epoch conversion (1601 â†’ 1970 UTC adjustment)
- âœ… `pkg/cli/lscolors/stat_windows.go`: Improved file feature detection implementation
  - Documented performance considerations for hard link detection
  - Provided clear implementation path for future enhancement
  - Maintained compatibility with existing Unix behavior
- âœ… `pkg/eval/compile_value.go`: Fixed Windows path handling correctness
  - Added support for both `/` and `\` path separators in tilde expansion
  - Implemented proper cross-platform path joining using `filepath.Join`
  - Removed hardcoded Unix-only path separator assumptions

**Remaining Implementation Tasks**:

#### Terminal Support  
- `pkg/cli/term/reader_windows.go`: Improve key sequence normalization for Windows console (currently Unix-centric)
- Windows TTY improvements and better console integration

#### Cross-Platform Path Handling

## Long-term / Major Refactoring Projects

### TUI Stack Rewrite
**Status**: ðŸ”® LONG-TERM PLAN - Moved to long-term roadmap (2025-08-24)  
**Location**: `pkg/edit` (62 files), `pkg/cli` (109 files)  
**Scope**: Complete rewrite of Terminal User Interface framework (~22K lines of code)  
**Description**: Major architectural refactoring of the entire TUI stack. The current editor implementation built on `cli.App` needs modernization.

**Analysis Summary** (completed 2025-08-24):
- **Architecture**: Layered design with pkg/edit built on pkg/cli framework
- **Technical Debt**: 30+ TODO items identified in codebase
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Breaking changes to core user interface
- **Resource Estimate**: 9-12 months development cycle
- **Team Requirements**: 4-5 dedicated developers (architect, core devs, test engineer, documentation)

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Phase 1** (2-3 months): Architecture design and prototyping
- **Phase 2** (4-5 months): Core framework rewrite and component migration  
- **Phase 3** (2-3 months): Integration testing, documentation, and release preparation

**Success Criteria**:
- All existing TUI functionality preserved
- Performance at least equal to current implementation
- Improved maintainability and extensibility
- Cross-platform compatibility (especially Windows improvements)
- Comprehensive test coverage and documentation

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Gradual migration with feature flags
- Parallel maintenance of old and new frameworks during transition
- Extensive beta testing with community feedback
- Clear rollback procedures for critical issues

**Priority Rationale**: Moved to long-term plan due to high resource requirements and risk level. Should be scheduled after completion of higher-priority core language features and platform compatibility improvements.

## Notes

- Most TODO items are tracked as inline comments in the source code
- Priority should be given to items that affect core functionality or user experience
- Windows support improvements would significantly expand platform compatibility
- Major refactoring projects (like TUI rewrite) are documented in the "Long-term" section with detailed analysis
